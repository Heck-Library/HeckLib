# HeckLib
HeckLib is a TypeScript library intended to be accessible to all Beat Saber modchart creators. It should be easy to set up.

***

# Setup

## Node.js
> Node.js is the framework used to run the script in the first place, it can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). There's two downloads, LTS and Current, it shouldn't matter which one you use but I recommend the Current version.

## IDE
> IDE refers to your development environment, personally I prefer [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) due to it's simplicity.

## Library
> To install the library to your project, you can run `npm i hecklib` in your project, this should install all depenedencies to run your code. 

# Scripting

## Editing
> To start editing your map with scripts, you can download the template script for either language mentioned below: 
>
> - [JavaScript](https://github.com/Heck-Library/HeckLib/blob/main/script.js)
> - [TypeScript](https://github.com/Heck-Library/HeckLib/blob/main/script.ts)

## Running The Script
> To run the script, just run the command `node script.js` if you're on JavaScript. Or the command `tsx script.ts`. 
> 
> If the TypeScript command doesn't work, you might need to install `tsx` using `npm i -g tsx`. And if it still doesn't work, you might need to run it with `npx tsx script.ts`
> 
> If you want to run the script everytime you save (or press `ctrl + s`), you can run it using nodemon. To install nodemon, just run `npm i -g nodemon`.

## Documentation

> Documentation is built into the library using `JSDoc` which is a standard for documenting JavaScript and TypeScript code.
>
> In Visual Studio Code, the easiest way to see it is to just hover over the component you need documentation for, and an explanation should pop up.
